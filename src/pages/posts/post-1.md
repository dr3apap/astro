<!-- # My First Blog Post
y first astro learning tutorial. I'm excited to code my blog with astro integration. 
## What I've accomplished -->

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
